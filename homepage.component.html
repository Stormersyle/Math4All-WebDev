          <h2> Our Mission </h2>
          <p> Inequity in education is one of the major problems in today’s society. Students from low-income families and marginalized communities are often unable to pursue their passions and explore their intellectual interests, due to the lack of opportunity and resources; this is especially the case in the field of mathematics, where many books/classes are very expensive. At Math4all, we combat this problem head-on by providing free, accessible math education to these students, along with individualized support to help them fully realize their potential in mathematics. 

            Our belief is that everyone deserves to have the opportunity to pursue their passion for math, regardless of their family’s socioeconomic status, the color of their skin, or the location in which they live. At Math4All, our mission is to make this a reality. <p>
